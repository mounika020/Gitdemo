What is the difference between static and not static variable?
Static variables are preceded by static keyword. For non-static variable, there is not any preceding keyword.
Memory is allocated for static variables at the time of class loading. Memory is allocated to non- static variables whenever an object is created.
Memory is allocated only once to static variables on class loading. Memory is allocated multiple time whenever a new object is created to non-static variables.
Static variable example : Collage name of students, Company name of employees..

7 : What is the difference between static and not static(Instance) method?
Answer : Difference between static and non static method is as bellow.
Method declared with static keyword is static method. If Method declared without static keyword then it is instance method.
No need of object to call static methods. Object needed to call instance method.
Can not access non static stuff inside static methods directly. Opposite to it, We can access static and non static stuff directly inside instance method.


What is return type of testng @DataProvider annotation method?  -> It will return 2-D object array “Object[][]”.
Constructor must not have any return type

General Questions:
-----------------
When do you prefer an interface over abstract class and vice versa?
Use abstract clases and inheritance if you can make the statement “A is a B”. Use interfaces if you can make the statement “A is capable of [doing] as”, or also, abstract for what a class is, interface for what a class can do.

When we talk about abstract classes we are defining characteristics of an object type; specifying what an object is.
When we talk about an interface and define capabilities that we promise to provide, we are talking about establishing a contract about what the object can do.

What is @Factory annotation in TestNG -> TestNG @Factory Annotation. TestNG @Factory annotation is used to specify a method as a factory for providing objects to be used by TestNG for test classes. The method marked with @Factory annotation should return Object array
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many TestNG annotations are there? - Total 15 TestNG Annotations -> @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod, @Test, @AfterSuite, @AfterTest, @AfterClass, @AfterMethod,@BeforeGroups, @AfterGroups, @DataProvider, @Listners,@Parameters,@Factory
